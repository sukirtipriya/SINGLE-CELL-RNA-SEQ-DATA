# SINGLE-CELL-RNA-SEQ-DATA-TYPE

In recent years single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has become widely used for transcriptome analysis in many areas of biology. 
In contrast to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq provides quantitative measurements of the expression of every gene in a single cell. 
However, to analyze scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some of the underlying assumptions for the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid.

It is now possible to analyse the transcriptome at single‚Äêcell level for over millions of cells in a single study. This allows us to classify, characterize and distinguish each cell at the transcriptome level, which leads to identify rare cell population but functionally important.
